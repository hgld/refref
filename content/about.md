Hi! I'm Henry Dillon and I created RefRef (short for Referee Reference) as a passion project.

I recently started out as a basketball official in 2017 - and it's easily one of the most satisfying and challenging things that I've done in a long time. My only regret is not starting earlier. 

As a rookie ref, I often found myself reading the rules and interpretations on my smartphone, but this wasn't easy using a PDF version. My background is in publishing and software and I knew there was a better way - so I decided to convert the content into an ePub format.

These reformatted materials are provided free of charge.

There were so many experienced officials that patiently helped me when I was starting out (and continue to do so!), so I am very pleased to have the opportunity to pay it forward. I hope these materials are useful for you. If you have questions or comments, please do [get in touch](/contact).
